# ðŸŒŽ According To
**According To** (AT) is a prototype blog platform that attempts to reduce combative social tendencies by better framing each post as merely someone's opinion.

It is a portfolio project of mine ([Dylan Landry](https://www.dylanlandry.com)) to demonstrate that I am competent with React and test driven development. 

This is the AT _API_. For the AT _client_, visit the [AT API GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyllandry/according-to-client).

The API is built with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) alone, an open source headless CMS. The AT client communicates with the Straip GraphQL endpoint provided by the [Strapi GraphQL plugin](https://strapi.io/marketplace/graphql).
